Fetching data from the server


Fetch API



web page (html+[stylesheets, scripts and images])
browser makes request to the server
trouble with traditional model: we'd have to fetch and load the entire page, even when we only need to update one part of it. 

JS API is used to request data from the server and update the page content without a page load. 

For data driven sites: 
Fetch API( enables js running in a page to make an HTTP request)
DOM manipulation APIs (use this to update the data which is in JSON format)

advantages: site feels faster and more responsive
            less wasted bandwidth.

EARLY DAYS : Ajax(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) - request XML data 
             
to request our data from database we use : server-side languages (PHP, Python, Node)
                                           
entry point of the Fetch API is a global function called fetch()
fetch() - Asynchronous api which returns promises
we pass a function into then method of returned promise. 

XMLHttpsRequest: XHR used to make HTTP request.
                predated fetch,first API widely used to implement AJAX
                used heavily in AJAX programming
